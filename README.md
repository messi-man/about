**Life seemed easy, for a while**

I was always drawn to technology and science. I rolled into software development as a 10-year-old because I liked to solve abstract puzzles. As a child, the amount of electronics I pulled apart were countless.

At the age of 18 I had taught myself enough to start working as a professional software developer. Meanwhile, I was getting my bachelor’s in an evening program, because you never know whether you’ll need the paper one day in your life.

When I was around 27, I started as a self-employed consultant. I started to take up leading roles as a team-lead and software architect at various companies and in challenging projects. And I was also involved with founding a couple of start-ups,  most of which failed fast or died slowly.

Life seemed easy, for a while. I was living a carefree life. Making good money, a lot of long-distance travelling, snowboarding, diving, and a lot of partying around the world.

In 2010, I took part in my first Mindfulness course, learning to cope with some difficult emotions. I was a bit sceptical at first to be honest, but it was validated by science, so why not give it a try? My practice developed slow but steadily, the benefits weren’t spectacular initially, but noticeable enough to encourage me to start practising daily.


**Entering the darkness**

In 2013 my father passed away unexpectedly. I was having dinner on a beach in a resort on Palawan (Phillipines) when I heard the new. The moment I heard the world around me turned dark. Weirdly enough the darkness stayed with me after the funeral and the grieving. I've been living in this darkness since.

**The need for purpose**

Meanwhile, I started to feel more and more dissatisfied with the work environments I found myself in, and the financial systems they work within. Working for companies with the main purpose of generating financial gain for shareholders couldn’t make me happy any more. I wanted to work with companies which had a higher purpose. Slowly things started to change, I was getting more careful with the companies I got involved with. And starting to prefer companies with a bigger purpose, over the companies who pay more.

I learned the importance of having a purpose in my life. I wasn’t sure yet what it was, but it felt more and more important to spend my time on meaningful projects.

**My spiritual awakening**

I started to gain more experience with recreational psychedelics and shamanic plant medicine. At the end of 2013 I did an Iboga experience, and in 2015 I partook in my first Ayahuasca experience.

Ayahuasca is a psychedelic tea, brewed by indigenous tribes in the Amazon. I had had quite some experience with psychedelics before, but this experience turned my world upside down.

For 8 hours I felt bliss and had the most loving and joyful moments of my life. Laying in fetus position I felt nurtured by mother earth. The experience gave me the feeling of being in touch with a higher intelligence or consciousness. A feeling I will never forget. 

I saw visions of a green/blue tree, the tree of life (Noya Rao), and heard a voice telling me that I would do something with the spiritual experience in the future, some kind of public function. I had no clue what it all meant. I would only become clear 8 years later...

I realized I wasn't very confident lately, and that I needed to regain my power before I would be able to act in public. The experience also touched on some habits that were not serving, the recreational use of alcohol and occasionally use of cocaine. I fully stopped drinking for a while after the experience.

**The suffering**

After a trip to Africa in late 2015, I started to notice strange physical symptoms in my body. It started very gradually. Over the course of two years I started to become sick more often. In the beginning of 2018 the problems became much worse. The sickness became worse. For over 10 months my stomach hurt intenesly. I had the feeling of a stomach bug at least half of the time. I started to become really worried and went to visit more and more doctors. They all concluded, even though I could hardly do anything any more, that I was fine because their tests didn’t show anything. From that summer I could only work half-time, sharing my time between work, my bed, and the sofa. Until I tested positive for a parasite. At first, it was a relief. With the help of strong medicine and a few rounds of Kambo, I was able to eradicate the parasite.

Unfortunately, the problems of fatigue relapses after being exposed to mild (physical) stress remained. After a series of doctor’s visits, I was diagnosed with Post-Infectious Fatigue Syndrome. A chronic diagnosis, from which less than [10% fully recover](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125123549/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369194/), something that probably stay for a lifetime. Even individuals who claim to have recovered are unable to resume pre-illness activity levels. It was a hard reality to swallow. I had to stop working, as pushing my limits only made the situation worse. With my limited mental capabilities, I started to research and implement everything I could do to improve my health situation.

**Acceptance**

I spent months in my bed and on my sofa. Just me, my thoughts, emotions and pain in my body. This is when I took a deep dive into my Mindfulness practice, and started to apply acceptance in all aspects of life.

Everything I thought defined me was falling apart.

I had severe pain in my belly and other parts of the body. So I learned to accept physical pain in my body and surprisingly found out that pain is perceived much less when you accept it.

I was so drained of energy, that I could hardly leave the house for months. So I became much more aware of my limits and I accepted that I had decreased health and fitness; perhaps for the rest of my life.

My mind shut down and I was not able to continue software development or anything else cognitively challenging. So, I accepted that my cognitive capabilities were not there any more and would maybe never come back.

Being self-employed doesn’t give much financial security where I live, so I had to accept that the financial consequences of going through this were going to be enormous. Especially since my insurance doesn’t believe I’m (mostly) unable to work.

I learned to cry again, something I hadn’t done since I was a child. While diving deeper into my meditation practice, I also learned to observe and feel emotions. How I can allow them to be without being caught up in them.

I thought about death, and  sometimes I even wished for it, as it seemed more peaceful than the suffering I was going through. But I learned to accept that both suffering and death are inevitable one day.

I started to see the suffering and pain in other people, pain I’m sometimes involved with. And I learned that sometimes, the only thing we can do, is to accept that each of us has their own journey. Although we can support people, we can’t take their pain away or carry the pain for them.

I realized that the joy and love I felt during my ayahuasca experience was always there in the present moment. No matter which unpleasant emotions, thoughts, or circumstances we find ourselves in, we can learn to find this joy and love in the present moment.

I learned that I still was there, even though everything I thought I was made of, travelling, work, sport, money, was mostly gone.

I learned to accept and love life, just as it is in the present moment, without the need to be different.

I was grateful for what I’ve been through, I’ve learned to accept life as it is. It also forced me to focus on what really matters in life for me.

**New work**

In 2019 I decided to quit software development and to re-train myself to help people with the practices that helped me the most, mindfulness and psychedelics. I completed a mindfulness teacher course, and took a few coaching courses. After which I felt ready to teach mindfulness, help people with coaching and by offering legal guided psychedelic experiences in the Netherlands. 

**My spiritual journey**

After a few longer Ayahuasca retreats with a Peruvian Shaman, and 3 dietas in the Shipibo tradition, I finally started speaking full-time with the Spirit in September 2022. Spirit demanded everything from me. I had to let go of my new work, spent most of my time in isolation, and focus full time on the last part of my spiritual journey. Spirit started to speak to me every minute I was awake. We had conversations about shamanism, spirituality, my spiritual calling and how to complete my spiritual apprenticeship. I started searching for a woman named Sarah, and a few other people. My journey brought me to Peru, Portugal and the Netherlands. With the Spirit I deepened my experience of shamanism, and learned more about religions, world politics, crime, corruption and western psychiatry.
